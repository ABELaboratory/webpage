# Overview

ABE Lab is a Creative Europe funded project operated by three partners:
the European Digital Reading Laboratory (EDRLab), the Fondazione Libri
Italiani Accessibili (LIA) and the National Library of the Netherlands
(KB).

In the context of the European Accessibility Act, publishers are
producing more and more accessible ebooks. But many titles produced in
the past are still on sale, this is what we call the *backlist*. And
though the costs to keep ebooks on the market are often low compared to
that for printed books (which need physical storage and reprinting), it
is important to understand that ebook titles can also disappear from the
market if revenues no longer cover costs.

The main objective of the ABE Lab project is to provide guidelines to
European publishers for boosting the remediation of their ebooks that
are currently on sale and convert them into accessible versions. A
complete description of the project can be found on the [ABE Lab
website](http://abelab.eu).

To reach this main objective we first needed to collect data on the
backlist to know its volume and its composition. This document presents
insight on the number of ebooks actually on the European market and how
this number can be broken down by category and format.

This document provides key numbers and segmentation. A short explanation
on our methodology can be found at the end. Data sources and Glossary
can be found as annex.

# 3.5 millions of ebooks in the European backlist 

The last available [FEP annual statistic
report](https://fep-fee.eu/European-Book-Publishing-1467)[^1]
presents data from 2021. It states 13.4 millions titles in active
catalogue of which 3 millions are ebooks, representing 22% of the titles
on the market for only 12% of sales.

Based on the summation of the numbers we received from individual
countries in early 2023, we established a backlist of ebooks published
in the EU exceeding 3.5 million.

Since ebooks can be easily traded cross-border, the number of titles
available to consumers is much higher. Especially ebooks in the English
language are very popular for certain categories (like computer books or
scientific publications) and often outnumber local productions.

Since important differences exist between countries, which would lead to
different conclusions, we present detailed views per market size
(largest, medium and smaller). Title sales from outside the EU by big
selling platforms are treated separately as very few data are available
from those companies.

## Largest markets 


France and Germany both have a million ebooks each on their backlist. In
France we notice exchanges with Canada (Quebec), in Germany with Austria
and Switzerland.

-   France: 952.416

-   Germany: 1.055.369

## Medium markets


Italy, Spain, Poland, the Netherlands, Czechia and Sweden each have a
backlist of more than 100.000 ebooks. In a country like Belgium, we
already noticed that many titles are imported from France and the
Netherlands. Austria has the same situation with Germany (and
Switzerland)

-   Italy: 376.097

-   Spain: 336.757

-   Poland: 138.415

-   The Netherlands:102.000

-   Czechia: 126.229

-   Sweden: 107.561

## Smaller markets

Denmark, Greece, Romania, Portugal, Hungary, Bulgaria, Finland,
Slovakia, Ireland, Croatia, Lithuania, Slovenia, Latvia, Estonia,
Cyprus, Luxembourg and Malta have backlists of ebooks published in the
country itself between 80.000 and a few hundred titles. When adding the
reported numbers together, the total count for smaller markets exceeds
300.000 already.

## Sales from outside EU

Buying ebooks from non European retailers is easy since the deliverable
is a file that does not pass through border controls. SInce the EAA
targets European markets, we focused on data of ebooks sales by European
retailers.

International book selling platforms operate on the European market, but
getting accurate data from them is not simple as they operate outside of
traditional distribution channels. Below we provide a quick overview of
the collections available through those platforms.

- **Amazon Kindle**. Though Amazon does not publish exact numbers
   about ebooks that are available for Kindle, some sources estimate
   that more than 14 million titles are currently available[^2].
   However, as this number also takes into account a large number of
   titles without an ISBN, we can not just add this number to our
   estimate directly.

-   **Apple Books**. Though exact numbers were not available, and
   availability differs from country to country (due to licensing
   deals). Apple is known to offer millions of ebooks and audiobooks
   too.

-   **Google Books**: According to some sources, Google Books offers
   more than 40 million books in 50 Languages[^3], including 10
   million books for free[^4] ^.^ Here we have the same issue that
   this number can not be compared directly to the backlist estimate
   as we defined it. Given this magnitude, however, it will be
   interesting to see how Google will comply with the EAA.

-  **Kobo**: Kobo claims to have over 5 million ebooks and audiobooks
   available for reading directly on their e-readers and apps[^5]. In
   some countries they work together with local retailers (like
   Bol.com in the Netherlands) to provide subscription services
   including a lot of local content n case of Kobo Plus offered by
   Bol.com about 'hundreds of thousands').

# Different markets segmentations

## By category

To compare the markets in different EU member states, we needed to split
the complete range of ebooks in several categories, like fiction books,
biographies, children\'s books, books on art, etcetera. Especially as we
know that different types of publications each have their own
accessibility issues, we want to make sure we have a good representation
of ebook types in this study. Since many different categorization
methods are in use, we chose the Thema[^6] categorization scheme.
However, not all ebooks have been assigned Thema codes yet, and some
mapping from older schemas had to be applied to make estimates.

In general, we found that fiction books and others that are mainly text,
often do have a digital ebook version. Almost all bestsellers are
available as ebooks. For non-fiction, however, we notice that market
size influences the percentage of non-fiction books that have a digital
version. Since it is more complex to make an attractive ebook version of
a non-fiction book, the costs are considerably higher than for text only
books. In many publishing houses the production of complex titles is
even outsourced as this requires many skills that not all publishers
have in house. In smaller markets we noticed that non-fiction is
considerably less represented in the total ebook offering than in the
largest markets.

For example, in a large market like Germany non-fiction is about 86 %,
whereas in a smaller market like the Netherlands it is considerably
less: 57 %.

|**Category**|**Germany**|**France**|**Italy**|**Netherlands**|**Spain**|

|  **no label**|     4%|   11%|N/A|   2%|       N/A


## By formats

We obtained detailed data on digital formats of books on the market for
only 5 key markets: France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands and Spain. We
retained only mainstream text formats (EPUB and PDF). It shows a very
disparate situation, where the German market has only 3 % of EPUB3 files
but 60 % of PDF files, while France and Italy reach nearly 40% of EPUB3
files versus less than 25% of PDF files.

This disparity does not allow us to make expectations on the total
European market. As a consequence we did not integrate any format
related query in our wishlist for files to test.

The format repartition will have to be studied at national and
publisher's level in order to refine cost estimation.

Table: % of titles per distribution format in 2022.

|  **Market**  |  **% of EPUB2 in 2022** |  **% of EPUB3 in 2022** |  **% of PDF in 2022** |  **% of other formats**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
| France  |      12|    38|    22|  18|
|  Germany |      34|    3|     60|  3|
|  Italy    |     36|    40|    23|  1|
|  Netherlands|   75|    10|    15|  0|
|  Spain       |  20|    15|    40|  25|

By years
--------

We captured the evolution of distributed files formats by year since
2012 for the 5 key markets. The same disparity is observed as some
countries present a linear evolution, while others seem to produce the
same ebooks formats in 2012 and 2022.

The evolution of formats distributed through the years shows a
progression of the use of EPUB3 against other formats.

Table: evolution of distribution formats from 2012 to 2022.

|  **Market**  |  **EPUB2 (2012 / 2022)** |  **EPUB3 (2012 / 2022)** |  **PDF (2012 / 2022)**
|---|---|---|---|
|  France|        -11 (from 23% to 12%)   |  +13 (from 25% to 38%) |    -11 (from 33% to 22%)|
|  Germany|       -1 (from 35% to 34%)   |   +3 (from 0% to 3%)     |   -2 (from 62% to 60%)|
|  Italy   |      -12 (from 48% to 36%) |    +34 (from 6% to 40%)    |  -22 (from 45% to 23%)|
|  Netherlands|   -8 (from 83% to 75%) |     +9 (from 1% to 10%)      | -1 (from 16% to 15%)|
|  Spain       |  *insufficient data*     |  *insufficient data*     |  *insufficient data*|

# Methodology


We define ebook backlists in Europe as the collection of all ebooks
published and/or made available in any of the EU Member states. Since
there is no central source that provides this information, many
publication registration offices, distributors, aggregators, resellers
and national libraries were contacted. Given that all these
organisations handle only a specific subcollection and that these
subcollections have overlaps ,we need to be careful to draw conclusions.
Imported titles from outside the EU also make up a large proportion of
the backlist, especially ebooks from the UK, US and Canada.

We have collected direct basic data from 22 countries and detailed data
from 5 countries (France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands and Spain). This
collected data specified the number of titles, and the repartition by
categories and formats. We've completed that collection with annual data
published by the Federation of European Publishers (FEP) to get an idea
of sales.

## Counting titles


To get information about the numbers of ebooks that have been published
in EU member states, we started by contacting all (EU) ISBN agencies.
Adding up all production figures should give a good first estimate for
the total.

For a more complete estimate of what is on the EU market, it is not
sufficient to know what is published locally, but we have to take into
account what is imported from abroad. Especially with certain categories
of non-fiction ebooks (like computer books) we see that the local
production is limited and ebooks in the English language are dominant.
Some of these titles are distributed via local distributors and sold at
local retailers. Next to that we also see online platforms that operate
worldwide (Amazon, Kobo, Google, Apple) that provide their services
directly to EU consumers.

National libraries also are a proper source of information about ebooks
published in a country. Sometimes these national libraries play a role
in providing ISBN's to publishers and did respond when we requested data
from the official ISBN agency. Sometimes we contacted the National
libraries directly to obtain information on the availability of ebooks.
Especially when publishers have the legal obligation to deposit a copy
of their publications at the national library, the library also has an
overview.

## Classifying titles

Book categories are a way to isolate and regroup books with common
characteristics. Those characteristics may explain production choices
and technologies used.

We chose the Thema subject category scheme[^7] established and
maintained by EDItEUR. Thema aims at being the scheme for a global book
trade and is the most commonly used classification methodology. Even if
the use of Thema classification progresses, it is not the only
classification used, and since it is relatively new, not all ebooks have
been assigned Thema codes yet.

For older collections and countries where Thema classification is not
the main standard in use, EDItEUR provides Thema mappings[^8].

Another way to classify titlesis by production year. As workflows and
production tools evolve this is reflected in the way ebook files are
made. For building a representative sample set for our research, we need
to understand this development.
