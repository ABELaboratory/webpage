Are you providing tools to enhance ebooks accessibility? Let us know and take part to the [ABELab Remediation tools survey](https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/7355fb1b-91cf-c7dd-4b27-18f33ad87d04)!

This survey aims to know better the remediation tools available and their main functionalities related to the detection and correction of recurrent accessibility issues as well as the possibilities of conformity validation of the outputs. 

We'll update this page on a quarterly basis with a list of tools participating in the survey.
