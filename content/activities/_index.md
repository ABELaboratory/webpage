descripyion: This is the place to know how is going ABE Lab project
---

The ABE Lab project started on the first of january 2023. 

The main objective of the project will be achieved by analyzing and testing the processes and workflows by which ebooks of different types and formats (PDF, EPUB, Reflowable and fixed layout) can be transformed into accessible EPUB in the easiest and less expensive way. 

In the context of the project, the partners will test several workflows using existing open-source and commercial tools to perform remediation tests of inaccessible ebooks. The study will consider different levels of complexity of source ebooks and will evaluate the associated costs of remediation.

Reports on progress will be posted here.
