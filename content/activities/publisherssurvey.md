## Feedback request on relevance and expectations for the future

This survey aims to gather feedback on the ABE Lab project, its relevance and its impact for publishers who collaborated on the project or who are interested in remediation of backlist ebooks.

For the project partners, it is also a useful opportunity to ascertain the needs and expectations of publishers for possible future projects.
