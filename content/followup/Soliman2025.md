In 2025, FeniXX, a company for the digital edition of unavailable books from the 20th century, has leveraged ABELab findings and methodology to asses a 70k ebooks collection and automatically create key metadata.

This project helped funding the [Readium CLI](https://github.com/readium/cli) accessibility extractor and inference capacities and therefore benefits the whole industry.
