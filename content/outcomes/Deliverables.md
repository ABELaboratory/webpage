## Report on Backlist Data and gap analysis

Released on 2023, October the 30th. Diffusion: Public.

<blockquote>This document has two objectives. The first is to provide stakeholders with insight into an overview of the number of ebooks actually on the European market and their repartition by categories, formats and years of production. This is addressed in the first main section “Composition of the EU ebook backlist”. The second objective is to provide a view of the gaps to be filled for the titles in the backlist to reach conformity to the EAA. It is covered by the second main section “Gap analysis”.</blockquote>
