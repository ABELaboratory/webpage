ABELab has two main objectives : 

* Collect and analyze the detailed composition of ebook backlists in Europe
* Provide guidelines to European publishers for boosting the remediation of ebooks from their backlist.

ABELab is a 18 month project starting January 2023 and ending June 2024. 
5 workshops and 3 events will take place to involve and give feedback to publishers.

All the documents and publications related to the ABELab projects will be shared here in an accessible format.
