5 workshops and 3 events will take place to involve and give feedback to publishers.

Fondazione LIA has been working in the field of accessibility for digital publications since 2014. In these years Fondazione LIA has worked with all the major Italian publishing groups and several European and international organizations to help them make their publications natively accessible and to distribute them in mainstream online channels. To do this it works on the definition of production workflows, quality control checklists, procedures and technological tools. This have been possible thanks to the fact that since the beginning of its activities, LIA has actively worked in the key international organizations that define the standard for accessible digital publications, such as W3C, EDRLab, the DAISY Consortium and ISO. As for the R&D, LIA collaborates with the Institute of Information Science and Technologies (ISTI) of the Italian National Research Council (CNR), the Keio Research Institute at the Keio University, the Japanese Advanced publishing laboratory (APL) and with many technological companies and
experts active in the digital accessibility field. In recent years has been working alongside educational and scholastic publishers, such as Zanichelli, DeAgostini Scuola and Il Mulino, in projects aimed at making accessible their most complex publications.
